  abstract = {This study analyses the comparison between a traditional statistical methodology for bankruptcy classification and prediction, i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and an artificial intelligence algorithm known as Genetic Algorithm (GA). The study was carried out at Centrale dei Bilanci, in Turin, Italy, analysing 1920 unsound and 1920 sound industrial Italian companies from 1982–1995. This paper follows our earlier examination of neural networks (NN) (see Altman et al., 1994. Corporate distress diagnosis: Comparisons using discriminant analysis and neural network. Journal of Banking and Finance XVIII, 505–529). The experiments on GA were oriented along two different lines: the genetic generation of linear functions and the genetic generation of scores based on rules. The two types of experiments showed GA to be a very effective instrument for insolvency diagnosis, even if the results obtained with LDA analysis perhaps proved to be superior to those obtained from GA. Of particular interest, it should be noted that the results of GA were obtained in less time and with more limited contributions from the financial analyst than the LDA. Of additional interest is the relevance for credit risk management of financial institutions.},

  abstract = {The growing and diverse literature on insolvency is comprehensively and critically reviewed. The limited portfolio that small firms represent, in particular as regards their managerial capabilities, is suggested as an added reason for the strong inverse correlation of probability of insolvency with firm size. The evidence from a hitherto largely untapped source of data, the reports of the British Official Receiver, is analysed using contingency tables. The most important reason for their failure given by the owners of insolvent firms is weaknesses in operational management, particularly in the adequacy of their capital. Marked inter-temporal and interregional differences are evident within the data},

Finally, it asks whether a solution to the common poolproblem might not be sought through contract, or indeed through reliance onsocial norms..},

  year     = {2007},
  abstract = {Bankruptcy is the legal process whereby financially distressed firms, individuals, and occasionally governments resolve their debts. The bankruptcy process for firms plays a central role in economics, because competition drives inefficient firms out of business, thereby raising the average efficiency level of those remaining. The main economic function of corporate bankruptcy is to reduce the cost of default by having a government-sponsored procedure that resolves all debts simultaneously. The main economic function of personal bankruptcy is to provide partial consumption insurance to individual debtors and therefore reduce the social cost of debt. This chapter surveys theoretical and empirical research on both types of bankruptcy.
